# Naga
Naga is a declarative, stack-based UI module for [LÃ¶ve][love] projects, written in Lua.

# Features
Naga is designed to be usable by both games and applications, meaning that a single UI framework can be used by the game and its development tools.

## Core Features
Here is a brief overview of the module:
* **Declarative UI creation** - simple and self-documenting
* **Stack-based element creation** - auto-parenting/nesting
* **Themes** - multiple theme support
* **Mouse & Keyboard support**
* **Gamepad support**
* **Extensible**

## Elements
UI objects created with Naga are called **elements**. They are the core building block from which every other type are created.
The element object is intended to be minimal in that it has all of the most commonly required UI features, and nothing more. It designed to be a
building block, so that more complex/compound elements may be easily created with it.

All elements support the following configurable features:

* **Nesting** - one-to-many parent/child trees
* **Automatic resizing** - fit to children, can also be set to fixed
* **Automatic layouts** - free placement, vertical/horizontal lists, grids
* **Theming** - with cascading styles and substyles
* **Interaction events** - press, release, hover, etc
* **Dragging** - elements marked with `canDrag = true` become draggable
* **Drag & Drop** - draggable elements marked with `canDrop = true` become drag & drop elements
* **Scrollbars** - modern-style overlayed scrollbars that hide when not in use
* **Tooltips** - per-element tooltips
* **Context Menus** - ??? not sure how to do this yet, or whether it should be built-in
* **Labels** - ??? should this be its own element or not?

## Built-in Extensions
Elements created via `naga.create` are the sole element type provided by the module. Therefore, a suite of extensions are provided by default.
Default extension modules include:

* **Windows** - including titlebars & buttons
* **Buttons**
* **Checkboxes**
* **Radio buttons**
* **Drop-downs**
* **Trees**
* **Table Explorer** - for displaying Lua tables
* **Separators**

# Quickstart
Blah blah

# Example
Stupid example
```lua
-- main.lua
local naga = require "naga"

naga.push.create {x = 64, y = 64, width = 128, height = 128, canDrag = true}
	naga.create {x = 64, y = 64, width = 64, height = 64}
naga.pop()

naga.push {x = 0, y = 0, width = 32, height = 32}

function love.draw()
	naga.draw()
end
```
